title: Week 1 Bulletin - Rings and homomorphisms
comments: true

This week, along with administrative matters, we covered basic definitions, examples, and types of rings, and the basic definition and some examples of ring homomorphisms.  This material was all from Sections 2,3 and 4 of Tom's notes, and essentially covers all of that material that we're going to.

Math: Wednesday
----------
On Wednesday we had a very brief quiz just to see what you remembered from 220.  We then reviewed the formal definition of a ring, listed many examples, and introduced/reviewed three types of elements elements and the corresponding three types of rings:

* a *field* is a ring in which every nonzero element is a *unit*
* an *integral domain* is a ring which has no nonzero *zero divisors*
* a ring is *reduced* if it has no *nilpotent* elements

  For each type of element/ring we found an example from our list of examples.


Math: Thursday
------------

Thursday we introduced the formal definition of a ring homomorphism, and gave some examples.  We briefly started talking about category theory.  We proved that there is a unique homomorphism from $$\mathbb{Z}$$ to any other ring $R$.  We introduced the kernal and the image of a homomorphism $\varphi$, foreshadowing our work for next week.
