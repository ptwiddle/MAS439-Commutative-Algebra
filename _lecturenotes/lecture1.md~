Introduction / Motivation
=========================

*Commutative Algebra* is the study of commutative rings.  Roughly speaking, a ring a ring is a set with two operations, addition (written +) and multiplication, (written * or by juxtaposition) that behave like addition and multiplication that we are familiar with.  

Examples
--------

You are already familiar with many different rings:

 - the integers Z
 - the rational numbers Q
 - the real numbers R
 - the complex numbers C
 - Polynomials in any number of variables over any of the above, e.g. Z[X]
 - residue rings, e.g. Z/12Z


Algebraic Geometry
------------------

Algebraic geometry studies the zero loci of polynomials; for instance, you know that the set of points in R^2 satisfying x^2+y^2=1 is a circle.  

An example you might not be as familiar with is the set of points in C^2 satisfying z^2=x^3+x -- it turns out that this looks like the surface of a donut with three points missing.

The usual set-up in algebraic geometry is to take a field k, and f_1, f_2,...,f_n polynomials in m variables, and consider V(f_1, f_2,...f_n) the set of points in k^m where all the f_i are zero.  These zero sets are called affine varieties.

Connection
----------

It may seem that the two topics of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, as described above, are completely unrelated.  But one of the key points of algebraic geometry is to study a variety X by studying the space of polynomial functions on it -- which will turn out to be a ring.  For affine varieites
