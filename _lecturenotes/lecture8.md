Comments: True

Yesterday we introduced the definition of the quotient ring, today we examine some examples, and discuss some basic properties (the isomorphism theorems).

Examples
-----

A few familiar/trivial examples:

Example:  $$R=\mathbb{Z}$$
===
First, recall that last week we saw, using the Euclidean algorithm, that any ideal of $$\mathbb{Z}$$ is generated by a single element, (which is called a *principal* ideal).  Thus, any ideal $$I\subset\mathbb{Z}$$ is of the form $$(n)$$.  

The quotient ring $$\mathbb{Z}/(n)=\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$$.

And a trivial example:

Example: General $$R$$
===
Any nontrivial ring has at least two ideals; the ideal $$\{0\}$$, and the ideal $$R$$.  We have $$R/(0)\cong R$$, and $$R/R$$ is the trivial ring.



The most important examples of quotient rings for us will be when $$R$$ is a polynomial ring (particularly over a field); i.e., $$R=k[x_1,\dots, x_n]$$.


  
Example: $$\mathbb{R}[x]/(x^2)$$
====

Let $$R=\mathbb{R}[x]$$, $$I=(x^2)$$.  To understand $$R/I$$, we need to understand the cosets of $$I$$ in $$R$$; to do this, it often helps to pick a unique representative of each coset.

What are the cosets of $$I$$?  Given any polynomial $$p(x)=a_nx^n+\cdots a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0$$, we have $$p(x)=x^2(a_nx^{n-2}+\cdots a_3x+a_2)x^2+a_1x+a_0$$, and so $$p(x)\sim a_1x+a_0$$, so every coset of $$I$$ can be represented by a linear polynomial.  Furthermore, this representative is unique.  

So we can view $$R/I$$ as a two dimensional vector space, with basis $$[1]$$ and $$[x]$$.  How do these multiply?  We know that $$[1]$$ is the unit, so the only multiplication we have to check is $$[x]\cdot[x]=[x^2]=0$$, since $$x^2\in I$$.  


Example: Constructing $$\mathbb{C}$$ from $$\mathbb{R}$$
===

Again, using the division algorithm, we can write any uniquely as polynomial $$p(x)=(x^2+1)q(x)+ax+b$$, and so we see that $$\mathbb{R}[x]/(x^2+1)$$ is again a two dimensional vector space over $$\mathbb{R}$$, with basis $$[x]$$ and $$[1]$$; however, now we have $$[x]^2=-[1]$$.

Note that $$\mathbb{C}$$ is also a two dimensional vector space over $$\mathbb{R}$$, with basis $$1, i$$, and $$i^2=1$$.  Thus, we see the map from $$\mathbb{R}[x]/(x^2+1)$$ to $$\mathbb{C}$$ that sends $$[x]$$ to $$i$$ is an isomorphism.


Example: Finite Fields
====

You may be aware that there is a finite field over order $$q$$, if and only if $$q$$ is a prime power, that is $$q=p^a$$, for some $$a$$ and $$p$$ a prime.  Furthermore, any two finite fields of the same order are isomorphic; thus, it makes sense to talk about *the* field over order $$q$$, which we denote $$\mathbb{F}_q$$.

We have seen that if $$p$$ is prime, then this field is $$\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$$; however, for higher prime powers this is not a field.  Instead, the field $$\mathbb{F}_{p^a}$$ is constructed from $$\mathbb{F}_p$$ in a way similar to how $$\mathbb{C}$$ was constructed from $$\mathbb{R}$$.

We illustrate this by constructing $$\mathbb{F}_9$$. 

Consider $$x^2+1\in\mathbb{F}_3[x]$$, and consider the ring $$R=\mathbb{F}_3[x]/(x^2+1)$$.  The division algorithm again shows we can write any polynomial in $$\mathbb{F}_3[x]$$ as $$(x^2+1)p(x)+ax+b$$, where now $$a, b\in\mathbb{F}_3$$; and so we see that $$R$$ is a vector space of dimension 2 over $$\mathbb{F}_3$$, with basis $$[x], [1]$$.  In particularly, it has order 9.  We now show it's a field, by demonstrating that all $$8$$ nonzero elements have inverses.

$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
[1]\cdot[1]&=&[1] \\
[2]\cdot[2]&=&[1] \\
[x]\cdot [2x]&=&[2x^2]=[-2]=1 \\
[x+1]\cdot [x+2]&=&[x^2+3x+2]=[-1+2]=1 \\
[2x+1]\cdot [2x+2] &=& [4x^2+6x+2]=[-1+2]=1 
\end{eqnarray*}
$$

The finite field $$\mathbb{F}_{p^a}$$ is constructed as a quotient of $$\mathbb{F}_p[x]$$ by a polynomial of degree $$a$$.  Doing so requires being able to choose the ``right'' ideal $$I$$ to quotient out by; in particular, we would need criteria for when $$R/I$$ was a field, as in general we won't be able to check everything has an inverse by hand.

Exercise
===
Check that $$\mathbb{F}_3[x]/(x^2+x+2)$$ is a field, and show that it is isomorphic to $$\mathbb{F}_3[x]/(x^2+1)$$.


Properties of Quotient Rings
====

We'd like to focus on one property of quotient rings in particular, which is called the *universal property* of quotient rings.  

Perhaps we should first just state 

Universal Property of Quotient rings
====
Let $$I\subset R$$ an ideal, and suppose that $$f:R\to S$$ is a ring homomorphism, with $$I\subset \ker(f)$$.  Then there exists a unique homomorphism $$\overline{f}:R/I$$ so that $$f=\overline{f}\circ p$$.

Remark
===

The identity between homomorphisms $$f=\overline{f}\circ p$$ is usually represented as a *commutative diagram* as follows:

Each node is a ring, and each arrow is a homomorphism.  The commutative part comes in because it doesn't matter which order we follow the arrows in -- we can go straight from $$R$$ to $$S$$ by $$f$$, or we can first go from $$R$$ to $$R/I$$ by $$p$$, and then go by $$\overline{f}$$ to $$S$$.

Proof
====

First we show that if the map $$\overline{f}$$ exists, it must be unique.  If it existed, we'd have $$\overline{f}([x])=\overline{f}(p(x))=f(x)$$.  

This tells us what $$\overline{f}$$ must be; we must check that this actually defines a map, and that it is a ring homomorphism.  These are all routine mechanical checks.

For instance, to show $$\overline{f}$$ is well defined: if $$[x]=[x^\prime]$$, then $$x^\prime=x+i$$ with $$i\in I$$.  Then 

$$\overline{f}([x^\prime])=\overline{f}([x+i])=f(x+i)=f(x)+f(i)=f(x)$$

since $$i\in I\subset\ker(f)$$.

Checking, i.e., that it respects multiplication, we see

$$\overline{f}([x]+[y])=\overline{f}([x+y])=f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)=\overline{f}([x])+\overline{f}([y])$$

Checking addition and units are similar.$$\square$$
