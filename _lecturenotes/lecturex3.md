title: Lecture 13&#58; Review, more algebras
Comments: True

We began this class period with a lengthy discussion of the last homework.

During lecture itself, we investigate how the material we have study so far ideals, quotient rings, subrings interacts with the notion of Algebra we introduced in the last lecture.

It turns out that ideals and quotients behave exactly the same, but we have to be a little more careful with subalgebras, as they are not quite the same thing as subrings.


Quotients of algebras
===

Let $$S$$ be an $$R$$ algebra, with structure map $$\psi:R\to S$$, and let $$I\subset S$$ be an ideal.  Then $$S/I$$ is naturally an $$R$$ algebra as well.  It's certainly a subring, we just need to give a map $$\psi^\prime:R\to S/I$$; we just take the composition $$\psi^\prime=p\circ \psi$$ of the structure map $$\psi:R \to S$$ and the quotient map $$p:S \to S/I$$:

Subalgebras
====

In contrast to ideals, if $$\psi:R\to S$$ is an $$R$$-algebra, and $$T\subset S$$ is a subring, then $$T$$ need not be an $$R$$-subalgebra, as $$T$$ need not contain the image $$\psi(R)$$.  As an example, consider $$\mathbb{C}[x]$$ with its standard $$\mathbb{C}$$ algebra structure; namely the inclusion of $$\mathbb{C}$$ as the constant polynomials.  This has a subring $$\mathbb{Z}[x]\subset\mathbb{C}[x]$$, but there are no maps at all from $$\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{Z}[x]$$, and so $$\mathbb{Z}[x]$$ can't be a $$\mathbb{C}$$ algebra at all!

Fortunately, this is the only thing that go wrong.  

Lemma
===

Let $$\psi:R\to S$$ be an $$R$$-algebra, and let $$T\subset S$$ be a subring.  Then if $$T$$ contains the image of $$\psi$$ there is a unique map $$\psi^\prime:R\to T$$ that makes the inclusion $$i:T\to S$$ into a map of $$R$$-algebras.

Proof
===

This sounds complicated, but there's really nothing going on.  Since $$T$$ contains the image of $$\psi$$, we can just set $$\psi^\prime(r)=\psi(r)\in T$$.  The inclusion $$i:T\to S$$ is a homomorphism, so we just need to check that $$i\circ\psi^\prime=\psi$$, which is immediate.

Furthermore, to see that this is the fact that inclusions in rings are monomorphisms -- recall from the exercises that a morphism $$i$$ is a monomorphism if $$i\circ f=i\circ g$$ implies that $$f=g$$.  This means that if $$\phi:R\to T$$ were another map making $$T$$ into an $$R$$-subalgebra, we'd by definition have $$i\circ\phi=\psi=i\circ\psi^\prime$$ and hence $$i=\psi^\prime\quad\square$$

Although subalgebras are slightly different than subrings, they behave basically the same with some very minor modifications.


Definition
===
Let $$\psi:R\to S$$ be an $$R$$ algebra, and let $$t_i\in S$$ be a collection of elements.  The *$$R$$-subalgebra generated by the $$t_i$$*, denoted $$\langle t_i\rangle$$ is the smallest $$R$$-subalgebra of $$S$$ that contains the $$t_i$$.

Lemma
===

Let $$T=\{\prod_{i=1}^k t_i^{p_i}\}$$ be the set of monomials in the $$t_i$$.  Then 

$$\langle t_i \rangle=\{\sum \psi(a_i) m_i \text{ where } m_i\in T, a_i\in R\}$$

Note that this is identical to our lemma about generating subrings, except that instead of just taking $$\mathbb{Z}$$-linear combinations of monomials, we have to take $$R$$ linear combinations of monomials.

Similarly, the proof is identical.

Don't be scared
====

The notion of $$R$$-algebras may seem scary, but really we're just going to be working with $$\mathbb{C}$$-algebras, and the algebra part is just doing a couple of technical things for us:

1. It's nice to have $$\mathbb{C}$$ around -- it makes everything into a vector space, which can be useful, but also its algebraically closed -- every degree $$d$$ polynomial in $$\mathbb{C}[x]$$ has $$d$$ roots counting multiplicity.  This will be very useful.  Working with $$\mathbb{C}$$-algebras means we always have $$\mathbb{C}$$ around.
2. The downside to $$\mathbb{C}$$ is that it's infinite, and not even finitely generated -- any finitely generated subring $$\mathbb{C}$$ will be countable, but $$\mathbb{C}$$ is uncountable.  So, if we want to work with $$\mathbb{C}$$, we'll never be finitely generated as a ring.  Being finitely generated as a $$\mathbb{C}$$-algebra is a solution to this -- we get all of $$\mathbb{C}$$ for free from the definition, and we only are allowed to have finitely much more.
