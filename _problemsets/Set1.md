Question 1: Elements of $$\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}$$
============
1. What are the units in $$\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$$?
2. What are the nilpotent elements of $$\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$$?
3. What are the zero divisors in $$\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$$?

Question 2: Zero divisors in $$R[x]$$
===========
Let $$R$$ be a nontrivial ring, and let $$f=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots +a_0\in R[x]$$.   Prove that if $$a_n$$ is not a zero divisor in $$R$$, then $$f$$ is not a zero divisor in $$R[x]$$.  (Hint: If you're stuck, warm-up with a simple case like $$f=x^2-1$$)

Note (nothing to prove here):
--------
As a consequence of this question, we see that if $$R$$ is an integral domain, then so is $$R[x]$$.

Question 3: Counting homomorphisms
=======

How many different homomorphisms $$\varphi:R\to S$$ are there when

1. $$R=\mathbb{Z}$$ and $$S=\mathbb{Z}[x]$$
2. $$R=\mathbb{Z}/7$$ and $$S=\mathbb{Z}/49$$
3. $$R=\mathbb{Z}/14$$ and $$S=\mathbb{Z}/7$$
4. $$R=\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$$ and $$S=\mathbb{Z}/12$$
