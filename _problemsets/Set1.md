Question 1
========== 
(4 Points)

Each part gives a subset of a commutative ring.  Determine, with proof, whether or not each subset is a subring.

1. The subset of $$\mathbb{Q}$$ consisting of numbers with odd denominators, when written in lowest terms.
2. Let $$w=e^{2\pi i/3}=-1/2+i\sqrt{3}/2$$.  
  $$E=\{a+bw, a,b\in\mathbb{Z}\}\subset\mathbb{C}$$ 
(Hint: $$w^2+w+1=0$$)
3. Polynomials $$f\in\mathbb{R}[x]$$ satisfying $$f(0)=0$$
4. Polynomials $$f\in\mathbb{R}[x]$$ satisfying $$f^\prime(0)=0$$

Question 2
==========
(3 Points)

Let $$R$$ be a nontrivial commutative ring.  An element $$r\in R$$ is a *zero divisor* if there exists $$s\in R, s\neq 0$$ with $$r\cdot s=0$$.  Show that for a nontrivial commutative ring $$R$$, the element $$x\in R[X]$$ is not a zero divisor.

Question 3
==========
(3 Points) 

A not-necessarily commutative ring $$R$$ is called *Boolean* if $$x^2=x$$ for all $$x\in R$$

1. Show that in a Boolean ring  $$2x=0$$ 
2. Show that all Boolean rings are in fact commutative

Hint: $$(a+b)^2$$
