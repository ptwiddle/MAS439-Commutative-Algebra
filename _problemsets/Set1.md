Question 1: Definition of the direct product ring
===

Suppose that $$R$$ and $$S$$ are commutative rings and consider the Cartesian product of sets

$$R\times S=\{(r,s):r\in R, s\in S\}$$

Prove that $$R\times S$$ forms a ring when equipped with the following operations:

$$(r_1,s_1)+(r_2,s_2)=(r_1+r_2, s_1+s_2)$$

$$(r_1,s_1)\cdot(r_2,s_2)=(r_1\cdot r_2, s_1\cdot s_2)$$
