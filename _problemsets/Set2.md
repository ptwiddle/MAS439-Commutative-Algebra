Question 1: Homomorphisms between finite cyclic rings
====

Let $$k$$ and $$n$$ be positive integers.  Prove that if $$k$$ divides $$n$$, then there is a unique homomorphism from $$\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$$ to $$\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}$$, and that if $$k$$ does not divide $$n$$ then there are no homomorphisms from $$\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$$ to $$\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}$$.

Question 2: Some finitely generated subrings
=====
(2 points each)

Part A:
------
Let $$\omega=1/2+i\sqrt{3}/2  \in \mathbb{C}$$.

Let $$R=\{a+b\omega : a, b\in\mathbb{Z}\}\subset \mathbb{C}$$.  

Prove that $$R$$ is a subring of $$\mathbb{C}$$, and show that $$R$$ is finitely generated.

(Hint: $$\omega^2+\omega+1=0$$)

Part B:
------
For $$f$$ a polynomial, let $$f^\prime$$ be its derivative.

Let $$S=\{ f\in \mathbb{Z}[x] : f^\prime(0)=0\}\subset \mathbb{Z}[x]$$.

Prove that $$S$$ is a subring of $$\mathbb{Z}[x]$$, and show that $$S$$ is finitely generated.



Question 3: Nilpotent elements, zero divisors, and ideals
====
Let $$R$$ be a commutative ring.

Part A:
------
Let $$N$$ be the union of $$0$$ and all the nilpotent elements of $$R$$.  Prove that $$N$$ is an ideal.

(Hint: the binomial theorem)

(2 points)

Part B:
------

Let $$D$$ be the union of $$0$$ and all the zero divisors of $$R$$.  Give an example to show that $$D$$ need not be an ideal of $$R$$.
