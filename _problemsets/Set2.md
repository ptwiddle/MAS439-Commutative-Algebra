Question 1: Examples of subrings and ideals
===
List all subrings and ideals in each of the following rings.  Explain why the given subsets are subrings or ideals, and why there are no others.

1. The residue ring $$\mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z}$$
2. The product ring$$(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})\times(\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z})$$


Question 2: A non-finitely generated ideal
===

Let $$R$$ be the ring of continuous functions $$f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$$ with the usual pointwise operations.  Recall that we say $$f\in R$$ has *compact support* (or bounded support) if there is a real number $$M>0$$ so that:

$$|x|>M\implies f(x)=0$$

1. Prove that the subset $$I\subset R$$ consisting of functions with compact support is an ideal.
2. Prove that $$I$$ is not finitely-generated.

Question 3: Radicals
====

Let $$R$$ be a commutative ring, and $$I\subset R$$ an ideal.  Definte the *radical* of $$I$$ to be

$$\sqrt{I}=\{r\in R : r^n\in I \textrm{ for some } n>0\}.$$

1. Prove that $$\sqrt{I}$$ is an ideal
2. If $$I,J\subset R$$ are ideals, prove that

$$\sqrt{(I+J)}=\sqrt{\left(\sqrt{I}+\sqrt{J}\right)}$$
