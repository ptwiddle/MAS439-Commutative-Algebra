Question 1: Examples of subrings and ideals
===
(3 points) 
List all subrings and ideals in each of the following rings.  Explain why the given subsets are subrings or ideals, and why there are no others.

1. The residue ring $$\mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z}$$
2. The product ring$$(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})\times(\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z})$$

Question 2: Some finitely generated subrings
=====
(2 points each)

Part A:
------
Let $$\omega=1/2+i\sqrt{3}/2  \in \mathbb{C}$$.  Let $$R=\{a+b\omega : a, b\in\mathbb{Z}\}\subset \mathbb{C}$$.  

Prove that $$R$$ is a subring of $$\mathbb{C}$$, and show that $$R$$ is finitely generated.

(Hint: $$\omega^2+\omega+1=0$$)

Part B:
------
For $$f$$ a polynomial, let $$f^\prime$$ be its derivative.  Let $$S=\{ f\in \mathbb{Z}[x] : f^\prime(0)=0\}\subset \mathbb{Z}[x]$$.

Prove that $$S$$ is a subring of $$\mathbb{Z}[x]$$, and show that $$S$$ is finitely generated.



Question 3: Nilpotent elements and ideals
====
(3 points) Let $$R$$ be a commutative ring.

1. Let $$N$$ be the union of $$0$$ and all the nilpotent elements of $$R$$.  Prove that $$N$$ is an ideal.
2. Let $$D$$ be the union of $$0$$ and all the zero divisors of $$R$$.  Give an example to show that $$D$$ need not be an ideal of $$R$$.

(Hint for 1: the binomial theorem)
