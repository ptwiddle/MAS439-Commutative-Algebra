Question 1
======
(8 points)

There are 4 monic degree two polynomials in $$\mathbb{Z}/{2\mathbb{Z}}[x]$$; call them $$f_1,\dots, f_4$$.  

In this problem set we consider the four rings $$R_i=\left(\mathbb{Z}{/2\mathbb{Z}}[x]\right)/(f_i)$$.  Each $$R_i$$ has four elements.

0. Show that each $$R_i$$ has four elements.  (Hint: don't do case by case)
1. For each $$R_i$$, write down the full multiplication table.
2. For each $$R_i$$ determine, with justification, whether or not it is a field, an integral domain, and reduced.
3. For which pairs $$i,j$$ is $$R_i$$ isomorphic to $$R_j$$?  Justify your answer.
4. Which of the $$R_i$$ are isomorphic to $$\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$$?  Justify your answer.

Question 2

Let $$R$$ be a commutative ring.  Prove that the following are equivalent:

1. $$R$$ is a field
2. The only ideals of $$R$$ are $$\{0\}$$ and $$R$$
3. Any homomorphism $$\varphi:R\to S$$ is either injective or the zero map.  

(Here $$S$$ is any ring; The zero map $$\varphi_0$$ is defined by $$\varphi_0(r)=0$$ for all $$r\in R$$)
