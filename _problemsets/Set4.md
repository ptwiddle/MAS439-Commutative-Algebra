Question 1: Ideals in prodcut rings (4 marks)
===

Ideals of product rings (2 marks)
------
Prove that the ideals of $$R\times S$$ are precisely the sets of the form $$\{(x,y):x\in I, y\in J\}$$ for $$I\subset R, J\subset S$$ ideals.

Ideals of $$\mathbb{Z}/2\times\mathbb{Z}/4$$ (2 marks)
-------
What are all the ideals of $$\mathbb{Z}/2\times \mathbb{Z}/4$$?  Which ones are radical?  Prime?  Maximal?




Question 2: Eisenstein integers as a quotient ring (4 marks)
===

Let $$\omega=(-1+i\sqrt{3})/2$$, and let $$R=\{a+b\omega : a,b\in\mathbb{Z}\}$$.  In a previous problem set, we proved that $$R\subset \mathbb{C}$$ was a subring.  The ring $$R$$ is called the *Eisenstein Integers*.

Let $$S=\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^2+x+1)$$.  This week we prove that $$R\cong S$$.  It may help to use some of the things we proved about $$R$$ in the previous homework...

Bare hands (2 marks)
------
First, let's do this with our "bare hands".  Find a distinct representative for each equivalence class of elements in $$\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^2+x+1)$$.  Write down how to multiple and add elements of $$\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^2+x+1)$$ in terms of these representatives.  Compare this with $$R$$ to see $$R\cong S$$.

Universal Property (2 marks)
------
Second, give a different proof of this using the first isomorphism theorem.  This proof starts by constructing a homomorphism $$\varphi:\mathbb{Z}[x]\to\mathbb{C}$$ having certain properties...

Question 3: A maximal ideal (2 marks)
====
Prove that $$(1+i)\subset\mathbb{Z}[i]$$ is a maximal ideal.
