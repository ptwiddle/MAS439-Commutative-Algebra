The first exercise is some practice in thinking categorically -- in thinking in terms of maps between things, rather than about elements of things.  We use the following definitions:

 Let $$\mathcal{C}$$ be a category.  We say a morphism $$f:A\to B$$ is a

 - *epimorphism* if for any two morphisms $$g:B\to C$$ and $$h:B\to C$$, we have $$g\circ f=h\circ f$$ implies that $$g=h$$.
 - *monomorphism* if for any two morphisms $$d:Z\to A$$ and $$e:Z\to A$$ we have $$f\circ d=f\circ e$$ implies that $$d=e$$
 - *retraction* if there exists $$s:B\to A$$ with $$f\circ s=1_B$$
 - *section* if there exists $$r:B\to A$$ with $$r\circ f=1_A$$.

Question 1

1. Prove that in any category $$\mathcal{C}$$, any retraction is an epimorphism, and any section is a monomorphism.
2. Prove that in the category of sets, with functions as morphisms, that the function $$f:A\to B$$ being a retraction and being an epimorphism are both equivalent to being a surjection.
3. In the category of rings, it is true that surjections and epimorphisms are the same things, but these are no longer equivalent to retractions.  Give an example to show this -- i.e., give a surjective map of rings $$f:R\to S$$ that is not a retraction.  (Hint: a previous exercise about maps between $$\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$$ and $$\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}$$ might help.)

Extra thinking: What about monomorphisms, injections, and sections -- are these all the same for sets?  For rings?

Question 2

An object $$I$$ in a category $$\mathcal{C}$$ is called an *initial object* if it satisfies the following universal property: for any object $$A\in \textrm{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$$, there is a unique morphism $$f:I\to A$$.

An object $$F$$ in a category $$\mathcal{C}$$ is called a *final object* if for any object $$B\in \textrm{Ob}(C)$$, there is a unique morphism $$g:B\to F$$.

1. Prove that in any category $$\mathcal{C}$$, if an initial object exists, then it is unique up to unique isomorphism.
2. Prove that in any category $$\mathcal{C}$$, if a final object exists, then it is unique up to unique isomorphism.
3. Show that in the category of groups, the group with one element is both the final object and the initial object.
4. The category of commutative rings and homomorphisms has both a final object and an initial object.  What are they?

Question 3

1. Let $$R$$ and $$S$$ be commutative rings.  Prove that the ideals of $$R\times S$$ are precisely the sets of the form $$I\times J$$, where $$I\subset R$$ and $$J\subset S$$ are ideals.
2.  List all the ideals of $$\mathbb{Z}\times\left(\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}\right)$$.
3. Give an example of an ideal of $$\mathbb{Z}\times\left(\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}\right)$$ that is
 - not reduced
 - reduced but not prime
 -  prime but not maximal
 - maximal.  

(If you like, you may use that $$(R\times S)/(I\times J)\cong (R/I)\times (S/J)$$ without proof)

Extra thinking: Classify every ideal of $$\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$$ according to the above.
