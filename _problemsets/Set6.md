Question 1 (2 points)
===

A ring $$R$$ is called *Artinian* if it satisfies the *Descending Chain Condition*, namely, for any descending chain of ideals

$$J_1\supset J_2\supset\dots\supset J_n\supset J_{n+1}\supset \dots$$

in $$R$$ there is an $$N>0$$ so that $$J_n=J_N$$ for all $$n\geq N$$.

1.  Prove that an integral domain is Artinian if and only if it is a field.
2. Give an example of a non-trivial Artinian ring which is not a field.


Question 2 (4 points)
=======

Let $$I=(x^2+y^2-2), J=(xy-1)\subset \mathbb{R}[x,y].$$

1. Describe and draw the algebraic subsets $$X=V(I), Y=V(J)\subset\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{R}^2$$.
2. Find $$X\cap Y$$, and verify that $$X\cap Y=V(I+J)$$.  
3. Show that $$x-y\in I(X\cap Y)$$, but $$x-y\notin I + J$$, showing that $$I(X\cap Y)\neq I(X)+I(Y)$$ in general.
4. Finally, show that $$(x-y)^2\in I+J$$.

Problem 3 (4 points)
====

Let $$R=\mathbb{R}[x,y]$$.  

1. Describe and draw the algebraic subset $$V(y^2-yx)\subset \mathbb{A}^2_\mathbb{R}$$.  
2. For $$t$$ in $$\mathbb{R}$$, describe the geometry of $$V(y^2-yx, x-t)$$.  For which value of $$t$$ is the geometry different than the others?
3. For that value of $$t$$, find a function $$f$$ with $$f\in I(V(y^2-yx,x-t))$$, but $$f\notin (y^2-yx, x-t)$$.
