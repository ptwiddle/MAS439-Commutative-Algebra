Problem 1: Using universal properties (4 Points)
=======

Let $$R\subset \mathbb{C}[t]$$ be the set of polynomials whose first derivative vanishes at 0.

Part 1:
-----
 Using the universal properties of $$\mathbb{C}$$-algebras and of quotient rings, construct a surjective $$\mathbb{C}$$-algebra

$$\varphi:\mathbb{C}[x,y]/(x^2-y^3)\to R$$

(Hint: The universal properties give the homomorphism, to see it's surjective you'll have to do something else.  In a previous homework we showed that $$R$$ was finitely generated. Looking back at that may help...)

Part 2:
------
 Show that any element $$[f]\in \mathbb{C}[x,y]/(x^2-y^3)$$ may be uniquely represented by an element $$g\in\mathbb{C}[x,y]$$ of the form 

$$g(x,y)=g_0(y)+x\cdot g_1(y)$$

where $$g_i\in\mathbb{C}[y]$$.  Deduce that the map $$\varphi$$ from Part 1 is an isomorphism.

Problem 2: Ideals in $$\mathbb{C}[x,y]$$ (3 points)
========
Determine whether each of the following ideals in $$\mathbb{C}[x,y]$$ is prime, maximal, and or radical.

1. $$I=(y-1)$$
2. $$J=(x-\pi i, y)$$
3. $$K=(x^2+y^2, x^2-y^2)$$

Problem 3: Dimensions of $$\mathbb{C}$$-algebras (3 points)
=========
Recall that if $$k$$ is a field, a $$k$$-algebra is a ring that's also a vector space over $$k$$.  Determine the dimensions of the following $$\mathbb{C}$$-algebras.  For each, give a basis of the algebra as a $$\mathbb{C}$$-vector space.
1. $$\mathbb{C}[x,y]/(x^3, xy, y^2)$$
2. $$\mathbb{C}[x,y]/(x^3, xy^2, y^3)$$
3. $$\mathbb{C}[x,y]/(x^2+y^2, x^3)$$
