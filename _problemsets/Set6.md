Problem 1
=====

(2 points)

Show that $$(1+i)\subset \mathbb{Z}[i]$$ is a maximal ideal.


Problem 2
====
( 8 points)


For each of the following ideals, decide whether or not is radical, prime, or maximal (with proof).

1.  $$(x^2+4x+5)\subset \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}[x]$$
2.  $$(x^2+4x+5)\subset \mathbb{Z}[x]$$
3.  $$(x^2+4x+5)\subset \mathbb{R}[x]$$
4.  $$(x^2+4x+5)\subset \mathbb{C}[x]$$

Hint: Some aren't hard, but some are a bit tricky with the techniques we have now.   For the hard cases, here's one possible plan: first use the division algortithm to find a unique representatives of elements in $$R/I$$.  Use this to identify $$R/I$$ with a vector space or lattice $$\mathbb{Z}^n$$.  

Then, consider the multiplication by $$a$$ map (map of vector spaces / lattice, not of rings) $$m_a:R/I\to R/I$$ defined by 

 $$m_a([x])=[a\cdot x]$$

Use the identification of $$R/I$$ with a vector space to write $$m_a$$ as a matrix.   What does $$a$$ being a nilpotent / zero divisor / unit mean in terms of this matrix?
