Question 1 (2 points)
===

A ring $$R$$ is called *Artinian* if it satisfies the *Descending Chain Condition*, namely, for any descending chain of ideals

$$J_1\supset J_2\supset\dots\supset J_n\supset J_{n+1}\supset \dots$$

in $$R$$ there is an $$N>0$$ so that $$J_n=J_N$$ for all $$n\geq N$$.

1.  Prove that an integral domain is Artinian if and only if it is a field
2. Give an example of a non-trivial Artinian ring which is not a field.


Question 2 (4 points)
=======

Let $$I=(x^2+y^2-2, xy-1)\subset \mathbb{C}[x,y].$$

Describe the algebraic subset $$X=V(I)\subset\mathbb{A}^2$$.  Show that $$x-y\in I(X), x-y\notin I$$, but $$(x-y)^2\in I$$

Question 3 (4 points)
=====

Let $$J=(xy, xz-yz)\subset \mathbb{C}[x,y,z]$$.  

Describe the algebraic subset $$Y=V(J)$$.  Show that $$xz\in I(Y), xz\notin J$$, but $$(xz)^2\in J$$.
