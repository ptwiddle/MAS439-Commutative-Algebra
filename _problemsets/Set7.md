Problem 1
====
(4 points)

Let $$R=\mathbb{R}[x,y]$$.  

1. Describe the geometry of $$V(y^2-yx)$$.  
2. For $$t$$ in $$\mathbb{R}$$, describe the geometry of $$V(y^2-yx, x-t)$$.  For which value of $$t$$ is the geometry different than the others?
3. For that value of $$t$$, find a function $$f$$ with $$f\in I(V(y^2-yx,x-t))$$, but $$f\notin (y^2-yx, x-t)$$.
4. For that value of $$t$$, give generators for the radical of $$(y^2-yx,x-t)$$.

Problem 2

(4 points)

Let $$R=\mathbb{R}[x,y,z]$$.  

1.  Describe the geometry of $$V(xyz)$$.
2. Describe the geometry of $$V(xy+xz+yz, xyz)$$.
3. Find an $$f\in I(V(xy+xz+zy,xyz))$$ with $$f\notin (xy+xz+zy,xyz)$$.  
4. Give generators for the radical of $$(xy+xz+yz, xyz)$$.

Problem 3
=====
(2 points)

Give some written feedback to how the course is going, what's working well, what isn't, what could be improved.  You don't necessarily have to address all of the following in depth, and please don't limit yourself to these topics, but if you touch on the three main areas, and give an indication of how things could be improved when you say you aren't happy about things, you'll get the two points.
 
1. The homework: is it too long, too short, too easy, too hard?  Useful in helping your understanding, or not seeming to have connection to what happens in class?  Too uneven?  How long do you spend on it?
2. The lectures.  Example comments: I dislike the lectures with slides, because you go too fast when you have slides.  I like the lectures with slides, because you have careful, clear statements of all the theorems better.  I want more examples.
3. The notes. Example comments: I wish the notes were closer to what happens in lecture.  I think the notes are too terse / too long-winded.
