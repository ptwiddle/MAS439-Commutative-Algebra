Problem 1

Let $$R\subset \mathbb{C}[t]$$ be the set of polynomials whose first derivative vanishes at 0.   Equivalently, $$R$$ is the set of polynomials whose linear coefficient vanishes:

$$R=\{f=a_0+a_2t^2+a_3t^3+\cdots a_nt^n\}$$

1. Prove that $$R$$ is generated as a $$\mathbb{C}$$-algebra by $$t^2$$ and $$t^3$$.
2. Using Part 1, write down a surjective map $$\varphi:\mathbb{C}[x,y]/(x^2-y^3)\to R$$, justifying that it's actually a surjective map.
3. Show that any element $$[f]\in \mathbb{C}[x,y]/(x^2-y^3)$$ can be uniquely represented by an element $$g\in \mathbb{C}[x,y]$$ of the form $$g(x,y)=g_0(y)+x\cdot g_1(y)$$, where $$g_i\in\mathbb{C}[y]$$.
4. Deduce that the map $$\varphi$$ from Part 2 is an isomorphism.

For any set $$S$$, and any ring $$R$$, the set of functions $$\textbf{Fun}(S,R)$$ from $$S$$ to $$R$$ is a ring under pointwise addition and multiplication; that is, if $$f,g:S\to R$$ are functions, then $$(f+g)(s)=f(s)+g(s)$$ and $$(f\cdot g)(s)=f(s)\cdot g(s)$$.

Prove that if $$S$$ is any infinite set, then $$\textbf{Fun}(S,R)$$ is not Noetherian.  

Hint: If $$U\subset S$$ is a subset, consider the subset $$\mathbb{V}(U)\subset \textbf{Fun}(S,r)$$ of functions that vanish on $$U$$.  That is: 

$$\mathbb{V}(U)=\{ f\in \textbf{Fun}(S,R) \text{ such that } f(u)=0 \text{ for all } u\in U\}$$

Prove that if $$R$$ is Noetherian, then the formal power series ring $$R[[x]]$$ is Noetherian.

Hint: The proof is a small tweak of the proof of the Hilbert basis theorem, and this exercise is meant to make sure you understand that proof.  An element of the formal power series ring doesn't have a highest degree term, so you have to use something slightly different instead...
