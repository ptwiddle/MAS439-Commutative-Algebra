Question 1 (3 points)
===

Consider the algebraic subset $$X=V(J)\subset\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{C}^3$$ where

$$J=(xy-zy-z^2x+z^3, x^2-xz-xy+yz)$$

Compute the irreducible components of $$X$$, carefully proving that each component you give is indeed irreducible.

Question 2 (3 points)
====

This exercise uses some very basic definitions from pointset topology.  Recall that if $$X$$ is a topological space, a set $$A$$ is called *closed* if the complement of $$A$$ in $$X$$ is open.

A topological space $$X$$ is called *reducible* if it can be written as $$X=A\cup B$$ with $$A$$ and $$B$$ proper (i.e. not all of $$X$$) closed subsets.  If $$X$$ cannot be written in this way it is called *irreducible*.

Recall that a function $$f:X\to Y$$ is continuous if the pullback of every open set is open -- i.e., if $$U\subset Y$$ is open, then $$f^{-1}(U)\subset X$$ is open.  

1. Show that $$\mathbb{R}$$ in its usual topology is not irreducible.
2. Show that $$f$$ is continuous if and only if the pullback of every closed set is closed.
3. If $$f:X\to Y$$ is a surjective continuous map, and $$X$$ is irreducible, prove that $$Y$$ is irreducible.

Question 3 (4 points)
===
 
In last week's problem set, we looked at the ideal $$J=(x^2+y^2-2, xy-1)\subset R=\mathbb{C}[x,y]$$.  This week, we compute the radical $$\sqrt{J}$$ using the Nullstellensatz.

1. Last week, we saw that $$V(J)=\{(1,1), (-1,-1)\}$$.  Using this, show that $$\dim_\mathbb{C}R/I(V(J))=2$$.  One way to do this is to show that every element of $$R/I(V(J))$$ has a unique representative of the form $$ax+b$$ for some $$a,b\in\mathbb{C}$$.  
2. Show that $$(x^2-1, x-y)= V(I(J))$$ by showing $$(x^2-1,x-y)\subset V(I(J))$$ and that $$\dim_{\mathbb{C}} R/(x^2-1, x-y)=2$$
3. Conclude that $$\sqrt{J}=(x^2-1, x-y)$$.
