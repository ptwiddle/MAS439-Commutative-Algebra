Problem 1
====
(4 points)

Consider the algebraic subset $$V=V(I)\subset \mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{C}}^2$$, where

$$I=(x^3-y^3, x^2-y^2+2x-2y)$$

Compute the irreducible components of $$V$$, carefully checking that each component actually is irreducible.

Question 2
====
(6 points)


Consider the algebraic subset $$V=V(I)\subset \mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{C}}^3$$, where:

$$I=(xy,xz,yz)$$

First, give an explicit description of the coordinate ring $$\mathbb{C}[V]$$.

Then, give an example of an ideal $$J\subset\mathbb{C}[V]$$ satisfying each of the following:

1. $$J$$ is radical but not prime
2. $$J$$ is prime but not maximal
3. $$J$$ is maximal

For each of the ideals $$J\subset \mathbb{C}[V]$$, give a precise geometrical description of the corresponding algebraic subset $$V(J)\subset V$$.
