Problem 1
====
(2 points)

Give an example, with proof, that an infinite union of algebraic sets need not be algebraic.  (Hint: it's probably easiest to think about $$\mathbb{Z}\subset\mathbb{C}$$...)



Problem 2
====
(4 points)

Let $$R=\mathbb{R}[x,y]$$.  

1. Describe the geometry of $$V(y^2-yx)$$.  
2. For $$t$$ in $$\mathbb{R}$$, describe the geometry of $$V(y^2-yx, x-t)$$.  For which value of $$t$$ is the geometry different than the others?
3. For that value of $$t$$, find a function $$f$$ with $$f\in I(V(y^2-yx,x-t))$$, but $$f\notin (y^2-yx, x-t)$$.
4. For that value of $$t$$, give generators for the radical of $$V(y^2-yx,x-t)$$.

Problem 3
====
(4 points)

Let $$R=\mathbb{R}[x,y,z]$$.  

1.  Describe the geometry of $$V(xyz)$$.
2. Describe the geometry of $$V(xy+xz+xy, xyz)$$.
3. Find an $$f\in I(V(xy+xz+zy,xyz))$$ with $$f\notin (xy+xz+zy,xyz)$$.  
4. Give generators for the radical of $$(xy+xz+yz, xyz)$$.
