Question 1 (4 points):
====

Consider the algebraic subset $$Z=V(I)\subset \mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{C}}^3$$, where

$$I=(xy,xz,yz)\subset\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]$$

First, give an explicit description of the coordinate ring $$\mathbb{C}[Z]$$.  Then, give explicit examples of ideals $$J\subset\mathbb{C}[Z]$$ such that:

1. $$J$$ is radical but not prime
2. $$J$$ is prime but not maximal
3. $$J$$ is maximal

In each case, give a precise geometrical description of the correspondending algebraic subset $$V(J)\subset Z$$.

Question 2 (3 points):
====
1. Consider the map $$f:\mathbb{A}^1_{\mathbb{C}}\to\mathbb{A}^3_{\mathbb{C}}$$ given by $$f(t)=(t^2,t^3,t^4)$$. Prove that the image of $$f$$ is an algebraic subset of $$\mathbb{A}^3_\mathbb{C}$$.
2. Let $$Y=V(xy-1)\subset \mathbb{A}^2_{\mathbb{C}}$$, and consider the map $$g:Y\to \mathbb{A}^1_{\mathbb{C}}$$ given by $$g(x,y)=x$$.  Prove that the image of $$g$$ is *not* an algebraic subset of $$\mathbb{A}^1_{\mathbb{C}}$$.



Question 3 (3 points):
===

The *nodal cubic* is the algebraic set $$X=V(y^2-x^3-x^2)$$.  

1. Sketch the real part of $$X$$, by considering how it is related to the graph of $$y=x^3+x^2$$.
2. Show that the map $$\varphi:\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{C}}^1\to \mathbb{A}^2_{\mathbb{C}}$$ given by $$\varphi(t)=(t^2-1, t^3-t)$$ lands inside $$X$$.
3. Show that the map $$\varphi$$ is surjective onto $$X$$.  Where does $$\varphi$$ fail to be injective?


Note: The map $$\varphi$$ has the following geometric interpretation, which may be enlightening.  Consider the line through the origin with slope $$t$$, i.e., $$y=tx$$.  If we restrict $$y^2-x^3-x^2$$ to this line, it will be a cubic polynomial in one variable, and hence have three roots.  The origin will always be a double root, and hence there will be one more root.  Geometrically, this means the line $$y=tx$$ intersects $$X$$ at the origin with multiplicity two, and at one *other* point.  This other point is $$h(t)$$.
