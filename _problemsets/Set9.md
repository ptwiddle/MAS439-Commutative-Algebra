Question 1 (5 points):
====

Let $$G=\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$$, and let $$g\in G$$ be a generator.  Let $$\omega=\exp(2\pi i / n)\in\mathbb{C}$$ be a primitive $$n$$th root of unity.  Let $$G$$ act on $$\mathbb{C}^2$$ by $$g\cdot(x,y)=(\omega x,\omega^{-1}y)$$, and on $$\mathbb{C}[x,y]$$ in the same way.

1. Let
$$\mathbb{C}[x,y]^G=\{f\in \mathbb{C}[x,y] : g\cdot f=f \;\forall g\in G\}.$$
Prove that $$\mathbb{C}[x,y]^G$$ is the $$\mathbb{C}$$-subalgebra of $$\mathbb{C}[x,y]$$ generated by $$x^n, y^n$$ and $$xy$$.
2. Prove that $$\mathbb{C}[x,y]^G\cong \mathbb{C}[u,v,w]/(uv-w^n)$$
3. The inclusion map $$i:\mathbb{C}[x,y]^G\to\mathbb{C}[x,y]$$ corresponds to some polynomial map $$p:\mathbb{A}^2_{\mathbb{C}}\to V(w^n-uv)\subset \mathbb{A}^3_{\mathbb{C}}$$ -- trace through the correspondence to determine explicitly the map $$p$$.
4. If $$a,b\in \mathbb{A}^2_{\mathbb{C}}$$, prove that $$p(a)=p(b)$$ if and only if $$a=g\cdot b$$ for some $$g\in G$$.  

Thus, we see that $$V(uv-w^n)$$ is the quotient $$\mathbb{A}^2_{\mathbb{C}}/G$$.



 
Question 2 (5 points):
====
Let $$K$$ be an algebraic closed field, and let $$X\subset \mathbb{A}^n_k$$ and $$Y\subset \mathbb{A}^m_k$$ be algebraic sets.  Let $$\varphi:X\to Y$$ be a polynomial map and let $$\varphi^*:k[Y]\to k[X]$$ be the corresponding map between coordinate rings.

1. Prove that if $$\varphi$$ is surjective, then $$\varphi^*$$ is injective.
2. Prove that if $$\varphi^*$$ is surjective, then $$\varphi$$ is injective.
3. Give examples showing that the converses to 1 and 2 don't hold

Hints: Two points are different iff there is a polynomial that takes on different values at p and q.  Two polynomials are the same iff they take on the same value at every point.  For 3, one of the examples from the previous homework may help...
