Question 1: Finishing an example 
=====
(2 points)


In class, we discussed the conifold variety $$X=V(xy-zw)\subset \mathbb{A}^4_{\mathbb{C}}$$, and the rational function $$r=y/z\in k(X)$$, and began discussing the domain of definition of $$r$$; in this exercise we rigorously prove exactly what the domain is.

1. Recall the proof from class or the lecture notes that if $$p=(w,x,y,z)\in X$$, with $$z\neq 0$$ or $$x\neq 0$$, then $$p$$ is in the domain of $$f$$. Prove first that for any $$p\in X, p\neq (0,0,0,0)$$ with $$x(p)=0$$ and $$z(p)=0$$, then $$p$$ is not in the domain of $$f$$.
2.  Finally, conclude that $$(0,0,0,0)$$ is not in the domain of $$f$$. 

Hint: tools from class / lecture notes help for both of these;  Lemma 19.3 in the notes is equivalent to "the set where a rational function $$f\in k(X)$$ is *not* defined is an algebraic subset of $$X$$," which we proved in class.



Question 2: An almost inverse
====
(3 points)

Recall that last week we considered the nodal *nodal cubic* $$X=V(y^2-x^3-x^2)$$, and the map $$\varphi:\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{C}}^1\to X$$ given by $$\varphi(t)=(t^2-1, t^3-t)$$.

1. Construct a rational function $$r\in k(X)$$ that is as close to an inverse to $$\varphi$$ as possible -- that is, $$r\varphi$$ and $$\varphi r$$ are both the identity wherever they are defined.
2. Prove that the domain of $$r$$ is $$X\setminus \{(0,0)\}$$.
3. Give an intuitive reason why $$r$$ can't be extended to the point $$(0,0)$$ in terms of the map $$\varphi$$.

Hint: Looking at last week's homework on this, and possible the geometric description and drawing a picture, might help.

Question 3: More polynomial functions
====
(5 points)

Let $$G=\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$$, and let $$g\in G$$ be a generator.  Let $$\omega=\exp(2\pi i / n)\in\mathbb{C}$$ be a primitive $$n$$th root of unity.  Let $$G$$ act on $$\mathbb{C}^2$$ by $$g\cdot(x,y)=(\omega x,\omega^{-1}y)$$, and on $$\mathbb{C}[x,y]$$ in the same way.

1. Let
$$\mathbb{C}[x,y]^G=\{f\in \mathbb{C}[x,y] : g\cdot f=f \;\forall g\in G\}.$$
Prove that $$\mathbb{C}[x,y]^G$$ is the $$\mathbb{C}$$-subalgebra of $$\mathbb{C}[x,y]$$ generated by $$x^n, y^n$$ and $$xy$$.
2. Prove that $$\mathbb{C}[x,y]^G\cong \mathbb{C}[u,v,w]/(uv-w^n)$$
3. The inclusion map $$i:\mathbb{C}[x,y]^G\to\mathbb{C}[x,y]$$ corresponds to some polynomial map $$p:\mathbb{A}^2_{\mathbb{C}}\to V(w^n-uv)\subset \mathbb{A}^3_{\mathbb{C}}$$ -- trace through the correspondence to determine explicitly the map $$p$$.
4. If $$a,b\in \mathbb{A}^2_{\mathbb{C}}$$, prove that $$p(a)=p(b)$$ if and only if $$a=g\cdot b$$ for some $$g\in G$$.  

Thus, we see that $$V(uv-w^n)$$ is the quotient $$\mathbb{A}^2_{\mathbb{C}}/G$$.
