<div class="home">

The first semester of the course will be based closely upon the <a href="MAS439LastYear.pdf">notes created by Tom Bridgeland</a>.  Last year I wrote up notes most of the individual lectures, which can be found here

Although I will follow those lecture notes closely, I will not lecture from the exactly, or post exact copies of what happens in lecture.  For each lecture I will create a short summary of topics, with links to appropriate sections of the old notes.







<h3>Most recent problem set:</h3>
<ul>
{% assign problems = site.problemsets | reverse %}
{% for set in problems limit:1 %}
<li>
<a href="{{ set.url | prepend:site.baseurl }}"> {{ set.title }}</a>  Due {{ set.duedate }}
</li>
{% endfor %} 
</ul>



<h3> Recent Lectures: </h3>
<ul>
{% assign lectures = site.lecturenotes | reverse %}
{% for lecture in lectures limit:2 %}
<li>
<a href="{{ lecture.url | prepend:site.baseurl }}"> {{ lecture.title }}</a>  
</li>
{% endfor %} 
</ul>
