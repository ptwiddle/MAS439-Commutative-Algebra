Marking
-------

There is no final exam for this course.  Instead, there will be weekly assessed problem sets handed out every week.

Problem sets will be handed out every Wednesday, and will be due the following Wednesday at the beginning of class.  Each assignment should be handed in with a signed cover sheet.

*You must keep your assignments after they have been handed back to you to return to me at the end of the year.  This seems silly, but is required for the external examiner.*

I highly encourage you to work together in small groups on the problem sets.  Working with friends is a great way to learn and is usually more fun.  I recommend groups of two or three, with four at the very largest.  

Although you can solve the problems together, each individual must still write up their own proofs.  Please do *not* write the proofs up together.  You must write the names of all members of your group  your cover sheet.

I recommend latexing your assignments, but this is not required.  The handout from the first day with tips about writing up assignments is available here.
