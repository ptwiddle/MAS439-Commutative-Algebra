\section*{Homework:}
How long do you spend each week on the homework?  Does this feel like too little / the right amount / too much?\newline

\vspace{5cm}

Is the homework too easy, too hard, or just right?  Are you happy with the marks you've been getting? \newline

\vspace{5cm}

What, if any, are one or two \emph{concrete} things that would improve the homework for you? \newline

\vspace{5cm}
\section*{Another other feedback or suggestions about the module?}

\newpage
\section*{Lectures:} 
Is the pace of lectures too fast / just right / too slow?  Is the intention of the lectures providing intuition behind the rigour of the notes clear?  Is the relationship between the lectures and the notes a muddled mess?  Somewhere in between?

\vspace{6cm}

Do you find the slides valuable?  Would you rather I just write on the board?  Would you rather I just copy the notes onto the board (or some less extreme sounding version of the same)?


\vspace{6cm}

What are one or two \emph{concrete} things that would make lectures more useful for you?
